# TicTacToe-ai
Creating a Tic Tac Toe AI bot using reinforcement learning from scratch in Python. Only numpy and the basic python builtin functions are allowed for creating the enviornment and the AI algorithm

## Currently implemented
* Tic Tac Toe enviornment (board)
* Q-learning algorithm

## WIP
* DQN network

## Current performance
100 games played and the starting player for each game is randomly assigned. When N --> inf. bot X and O should converge to same values.

Player: 'O'

| wins | draws | losses |
|------|-------|--------|
| 88%  | 6%    | 6%    |


Player: 'X'

| wins | draws | losses |
|------|-------|--------|
| 83%  | 8%    | 9%    |
